====== Gromacs ======
Created Wednesday 24 August 2016

== Overview ==
Classic Molecular Dynamics code using force fields, Gromacs is able to similate 10^8 partciles 

http://www.gromacs.org/

== Source ==
git clone git://git.gromacs.org/gromacs.git gromacs.git

Some patches are required (unless marked '''RESOLVED'''): 
* Patch1 (fixes [http://redmine.gromacs.org/issues/1280 Issue 1280]) '''RESOLVED'''
* Patch2 (fixes [http://redmine.gromacs.org/issues/1281 Issue 1281]) '''RESOLVED'''
* Patch3 (fixes [http://redmine.gromacs.org/issues/1282 Issue 1282]) '''RESOLVED'''
* Patch4 (fixes [http://redmine.gromacs.org/issues/1283 Issue 1283]) '''RESOLVED'''
* Patch5 (fixes [http://redmine.gromacs.org/issues/1284 Issue 1284]) '''RESOLVED'''


== Building in Blue Gene/Q ==


This is how to build Gromacs on Blue Gene/Q:
'''
mkdir build && \
cd build && \
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=BlueGeneQ-static-XL-CXX \
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/soft/libraries/alcf/current/xl/FFTW3
'''


NOTE: You //must// ''./build'' in an empty build directory.

== QPX ==
 
It would be nice to add QPX kernels to Gromacs.
* http://bugzilla.gromacs.org/issues/1064 has details.
* http://www.gromacs.org/Developer_Zone/Programming_Guide/Verlet_SIMD_kernels Implementing support for a new SIMD instruction set
* Need to ask for pointers on the nonbonded vector code, which appears to be auto-generated.

**Update:**  QPX support has recently been introduced in Gromacs.  Peruse the Gromacs developer list for more information.
