====== MPItrace ======
Created Thursday 25 August 2016

Use mpitrace library in JLSE (ONLY WORKS WHEN LINKING STATICALLY)

	Link your application against libmpitrace as follows: mpiicc foo.c -o exec -L/home/morozov/lib/ -lmpitrace
	Verify that the linking has been done as expected: nm exec | grep vprof
	Set up your environment for profiling: export VPROF_PROFILE=yes
	Execute your application: mpirun -n 2 ./exec
	Several profiling files should be generated as follows: mpi_profile.X.Y and vmon.out.X
	Generate readable text file: /home/morozov/bin/bfdprof exec vmon.out.X > FILE.txt
