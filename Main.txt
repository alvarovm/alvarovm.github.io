====== ALCF cookbook ======


== Foreword ==
	My intent with this notes is to collect some useful information
	to use ALCF computers and to make easier the slope on 
	the learning curve and to get ready faster for massive 
	calculations in BG/Q and KNL/Cray computers. 


== Just a guide ==
	I am committed with the success of every INCITE or 
	ALCC project in DOE leadership facilities. I will try to 
	keep these notes/wikis updated as much as possible.
	I will appreciate your feedback to improve the content
	and the accuracy of the herein text. 
	
	This documentation is offered "as is" and it is not an 
	ALCF official channel of communication, and overall, 
	it should not be taken as a definitive text guide.


== Feedback & Contact ==
	For further details and corrections of this material please contact
	to Alvaro V. Mayagoitia  mail: Alvaro:at:anl.gov
